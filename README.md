# Lunar-Lander
A nice, stylized version of the classic game Moon Lander, written in python because I was bored one day.

It quickly spun out of control, as most projects do, into a giant application with menus and GUIs and upgrades, and it's actually pretty cool now. The scene based pygame structure was extracted from this project, because it's not half bad, cleaned up a little, and put into https://github.com/smartycope/Boilerplate.
